DHT11-Library-for-MSP430
========================
This library interfaces with the DHT11 low-cost temperature and humidity sensor.
The library should be compatible with all MSP430 G2xxx series microcontrollers.
The only requirement is the TA0 timer.
It has been tested on the MSP430 G2452 and G2553 (included in the MSP430 Launchpad starter kit sold by TI).

The library is located in the DHT11_LIB folder.
The example code is located in the DHT11_APP folder.
